Hi humans!
Carlos here. My programming experience began in 1973, when I started programming with Fortran IV. I've also programmed (in the past) with 360 Assembly, BASIC, Pascal, Java, Forth, and most recently have committed to Python. I'm now trying to develop my skills to become a front-end web developer.
